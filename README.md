### Project Description
Goal: We plan on training a neural network to recognize picutres of about 10 different people (our friends) and then have the neural network be able to look at a bunch of different photos and figure out if any of the 10 different people are in the photos. It wil then count how many times each person shows up in the testing photos.
Dataset: We plan to use photos we took of our friends as well as photos found online through social media and the web. We also plan to use other random photos of various objects in our testing dataset to ensure there is variety in the testing dataset.
